User-Based CLOS
===============

Concepts
---------
Implement User-Based CLOS. I am not really sure about real architecture of AWS/MS Azure, but it seems like they allocate full system per-user with limited HW resource. <br>
But, rather allocating full system per-user without any knowledge of low-level of Linux system, I thought it would may better to allocate user in one-system FIRST, and expand it to system-per-user.

Goals
------
1. To know how to allocate additional user in one system.
2. Limit CPU usage per-user.
3. Limit Permission.<br>
   Since one system used, other user except for administrator should not excess violent system modification.<br>
   But, ironically, to do apt update and some system-related function, they need root permission.
4. Limit Disk usage.
5. Limit Ram usage.

The Questions
-------------
1. How do we manage permission?<br>
   As I mentioned above(Goals, 3), using root permission is inevitable for both normal user and administrator. But think about "sudo rm -rf /". If one of user does that, there is no prevention rule, or protection. System will blow up eventually.<br>
   So how do we manage permission efficiently with safe protection?<br><br>
   For now, I am thinking about creating new layer between command-execution. Something like this(I am not sure this kind a thing exists.):<br>
   `Input --> Command Check Layer(new layer) --> Execution`<br>
